# Project Description
Our sentiment analysis App is designed to help users analyse the sentiments conveyed in textual content quickly and accurately.

Starting from cleaning your dataset, Labeling it based on the polarity of the sentiments it represents in case you want to train your own model, to visualising the subjectivity and polarity of the data ending with predicting a text sentiment based on a pre-trained model, our application provides valuable insights into the emotional tone of your data.
